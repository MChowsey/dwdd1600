            <h2>Our Process</h2>
            <dl>
                <dt>Prepping The Jars?</dt>
                <dd>We pack all our veggies into the jars as tightly and neatly as possible, then we fill in the cracks with dill and garlic.</dd>
                <dt>Brine Cook Time?</dt>    
                <dd>We mix the salt into the pickling liquid until it dissolves and then heat the brine until it boils. Then, boil a few seconds more to allow the flavors to cook together a little longer.</dd>
                <dt>Sealing The Jars?</dt>
                <dd>We use the heat from the brine to tightly close the jars. while we do not do an official sealing of the jars by boiling them, the jars are always sealed tight enough that the button on top of the lid cannot be pressed and it takes some effort to open. Even with this in mind, it is wise to check on your pickles every couple of weeks to make sure they haven't spoiled or grown bacteria.</dd>  
                </dl>
            <p><strong>Side Note: </strong>Because the pickles we send to our customers are freshly jarred, it is recommended that you wait at least 5 days before opening for the best quality and maximum satisfaction.</p>
            <p>We all had to learn from somewhere! This is the original recipe we use, courtesy of Joshua Weissman :)</p>
